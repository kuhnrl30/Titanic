The purpose of this document is to explain the process I used to create the submission set for the Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster competition on kaggle.com.  The objective of the project is to predict whether a passenger survives based on several attributes.

The first step I took was to look at the summary level statistics for the data set

```{r}
setwd("/Users/Owner/Documents/Analytics/RProjects/Data")
Train<- read.csv("titanic-train.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
